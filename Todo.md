- I need to make a check for menu items to show up when in edit/object mode in temp_layout
- Figure out a better name for temp_layout or get rid of it and factor items into existing menus
- Need to figure out why this isn't working on the object level first, probably should take it out of the objects for loops
- Reorganize the scripts into appropriate folders
- Fix when no objects are selected rename popup warning
- Figure out how to make MergeCenter use other axis.
- Change all older scripts to register on import
- Change BlendNormals to have an option to apply the modifier immediately and also have the option for Mapping type
- Rework Local View Deluxe to work in this script
- Maybe rework my camera options menu into this as well
- Convert EyeIcon.png to SVG
- View3D_LatticeMirrorOperator doesn't have any UI element to activate it
- MergeLast doesn't have any classes to activate it via UI
- Need to add a 'Keep Boundary' option for Blend Normal
